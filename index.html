    <p>My name is Garcian D'Cruz! I want to welcome you all to my portfolio page. I am currently enrolled in the Coding BootCamp at UNC-Chapel Hill.</p>
    <p>I went to Chapel Hill High School and then I attended Elon University and earned my BSBA in Marketing.</p>
<p>I worked as a Digital Marketing Specialst for a year and quit to give my full attention to my coursework in the BootCamp. I also am a USPTA Certified Tennis Professional and currently coach tennis at Cary Tennis Park, Southern Village Club, and I'm the Assistant Head Coach of Chapel Hill High School's Men's tennis. I also am a recording artist. I released my first album in March of 2018 and it has hit over 220,000 streams on Spotify! I will be relasing more music soon in March of 2019.  </p>
