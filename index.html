    <p>My name is Garcian D'Cruz! I want to welcome you all to my portfolio page that I created. I am currently enrolled in the Coding BootCamp at UNC-Chapel Hill. This is my first homework assignment and I wanted it to count towards my portfolio.</p>
    <p>I was born in Mumbai, India and moved to the United States when I was 1 year old. I have since lived in Chapel Hill my whole life. I went to Chapel Hill High School and then I attended Elon University and earned my BSBA with a focus in Marketing. I currently work as a Digital Marketing Specialist for a company called GateHouse Media.</p>
<p>I also am a USPTA Certified Tennis Professional and currently coach tennis at Cary Tennis Park, The Southern Village Club LLC, and I'm the Assistant Head Coach of Chapel Hill High School's Men's and Women's tennis programs. I also am a recording artist working currently under my manager Nick Clemens.  </p>
